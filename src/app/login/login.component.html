                Happy Holiday
                While the merry bells keep ringing

                It's the holiday season
                And Santa Claus is coming round
                The Christmas snow is white on the ground
                When old Santa gets into town
                He'll be coming down the chimney, down
                (He'll be coming down the chimney, down
                </p>

                It's the holiday season
                And Santa Claus has got a toy
                For every good girl and good little boy
                Santa's a great big bundle of joy
                When he's coming down the chimney, down
                (When he's coming down the chimney, down)

                <p>
                He'll have a big fat pack upon his back
                And lots of goodies for you and for me
                So leave a peppermint stick for old St. Nick
                Hanging on the Christmas tree
                </p>

                With the whoop-de-do and dickory dock
                And don't forget to hang up your sock
                'Cause just exactly at 12 o'clock
                He'll be coming down the chimney, down
